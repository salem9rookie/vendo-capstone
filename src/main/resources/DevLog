Next Steps:
-Implement logger to catch exceptions in a format that doesn't display to end user.

-There are plenty of options to create tests.
-There are several methods that return void --
    ->giveChange inside VendingMachine could instead return a String or a double or BigDecimal

-double check the formatting of VendingMachine
